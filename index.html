  <h1>NYC Urban Planning</h1>
  <h2 class="custom-h2">City Planning History</h2>
   <p>Since adoption of the country’s first Zoning Resolution in 1916, New York City has played a seminal role in the history and development of planning and zoning. This rich history is captured through decades of planning reports, land use maps and historic photographs documenting a changing urban landscape. Many of these documents serve as a critical resource for the Department, for the City and for the planning profession. </p>

          <h4>City Planning Commission</h4>
          <p>New York City has been a pioneer in the development of urban planning in the United States; the nation's first comprehensive zoning resolution was enacted by the city in 1916. But it was not until 20 years later that New Yorkers voted to approve a new City Charter that established the City Planning Commission and gave it the responsibility to prepare plans and to draft and approve amendments to the Zoning Resolution. </p>

          <h4> Zoning History</h4>
          <p>As early as the 1870’s and 1880’s, New Yorkers began to protest the loss of light and air as taller residential buildings began to appear in Manhattan. In response, the state legislature enacted a series of height restrictions on residential buildings, culminating in the Tenement House Act of 1901. </p>
